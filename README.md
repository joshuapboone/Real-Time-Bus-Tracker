# Real Time Bus Tracker

In this exercise I built a simulation of a public transportation bus stopping at all of the predetermined bus stops along its route between MIT and Harvard.  I utilized a map and created a pin to signify the bus as it moves along its route.  I also included a button that starts the pin moving once the button is clicked.  This exercise brings together my skills in JavaScript and CSS.

How to run: Download a master file of this repository to your computer, which will be a zip file.  Extract files from the zip file.  Click on the index.html file and you will be brought to a webpage.  Click on the button that says "Show Stops Between MIT and Harvard" and watch the pin move across the map.

Roadmap of future improvements: In the future I would like to show more bus stops in Boston.
